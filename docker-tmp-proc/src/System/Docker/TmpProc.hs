-- Type-level proposal
--
--
-- What's the goal? Remove the need for UnknownProc exception by enhancing the types of Handle.
--
-- We probably want to use some form of HList, with tags or symbols indicating
-- the different types of TmpProc.
--
-- There should be various typefamilies, but essentially, the list of TmpProc should all distint tags
-- The tag should be used instead of Text to access the ProcURI and invoke reset
--
-- There is a typefamily and function that prevents us from adding using the same tag in a TmpProc twice.
-- already present to the list TmpProcs
-- a list of TmpProcHandle, with a type that is a list tags matching the tags of the TmpProc that created them

-- a function takes a tags and a list of TmpProcHandle and executes reset for a tag that is included in the list of TmpProcHandle
-- a function that takes a list of TmpProcHandle, and returns the ProcURI (without tag) for the given tag.
-- a function that takes a list of TmpProcs and generates the list of TmpProcHandle
--
-- Ready or not
--
-- Can we force the 'ready' action to be run using types ?
-- the main reason for it is that there is hook in Wai that takes a ready.
-- It'd be nice if we made it so that only services that need a ready get a ready.
-- How can we signal that a service will take a 'ready' action ?
